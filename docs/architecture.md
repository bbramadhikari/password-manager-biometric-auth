# System Architecture

## Overview
The **Password Manager with Biometric Authentication** project is designed to securely store and manage user passwords with enhanced biometric-based authentication mechanisms. The architecture integrates various components to ensure high security, usability, and scalability.

## Key Components
### 1. **Authentication Layer**
- **Facial Recognition**:
  - Tool: OpenCV
  - Function: Captures and verifies the user's face during login.
  - Flow: Uses pre-trained models to detect faces and match them against stored data.
- **Fingerprint Scanning**:
  - Tool: PyFingerprint
  - Function: Scans and authenticates the user's fingerprint for access.
  - Flow: Reads fingerprint patterns and compares them with the stored hashed patterns.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - Tool: PyOTP
  - Function: Adds an extra layer of security using TOTP.
  - Flow: Generates a time-sensitive OTP sent to the user's device or app.

### 2. **Encryption and Security**
- **Encryption Module**:
  - Tools: PyCrypto and Cryptography
  - Function: Encrypts passwords using AES encryption before storing them in the database.
  - Flow: Ensures data-at-rest security by storing only encrypted data.
- **Secure Transmission**:
  - Uses HTTPS and TLS protocols to protect data during transmission.
- **Penetration Testing**:
  - Tools: Security testing tools to identify vulnerabilities and ensure robustness.

### 3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- **Frameworks**:
  - PyQt/Tkinter for GUI logic and layouts.
  - Material UI for styling and aesthetics.
- **Features**:
  - User-friendly interface to add, view, and manage passwords.
  - Biometric authentication prompts during login.

### 4. **Database**
- **Storage**:
  - Encrypted passwords stored securely.
  - Biometric data stored in hashed or encrypted form.
- **Database Type**:
  - SQLite or PostgreSQL (based on scalability needs).

### 5. **Testing and Validation**
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Tool: PyTest
  - Purpose: Validates individual functions like encryption, MFA, etc.
- **GUI Testing**:
  - Tool: Selenium
  - Purpose: Ensures cross-platform compatibility and functionality.
- **API Testing**:
  - Tool: Postman
  - Purpose: Validates secure communication between frontend and backend.
- **Prototyping**:
  - Tool: Figma
  - Purpose: Prototypes app design and user flows.

### 6. **AI/ML Integration (Optional)**
- **Facial Recognition Optimization**:
  - Tool: TensorFlow
  - Purpose: Improves recognition accuracy under different conditions.

## Data Flow
1. **User Login**:
   - The user accesses the app and is prompted for biometric authentication (facial recognition or fingerprint).
   - The biometric data is compared against stored data for verification.
   - If verified, the user provides a master password and optionally a TOTP.
2. **Password Retrieval**:
   - The user selects a saved account.
   - The system decrypts the password using the master key and displays it securely.
3. **Password Addition**:
   - The user adds a new account and password.
   - The password is encrypted and stored in the database.

## Scalability and Future Enhancements
- **Horizontal Scalability**:
  - Transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL for larger datasets.
- **Cloud Integration**:
  - Store encrypted data on secure cloud platforms for multi-device access.
- **AI Enhancements**:
  - Use advanced AI models for better biometric authentication.
